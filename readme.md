# Chartink to TradingView.

This is a firefox extension meant to redirect chart links in Chartink Scanner output to TradingView charts.

Chartink provides great screening tools but lacks a good charting tool, whereas TradingView has an average screener but an excellent charting system. So this extension aims to bridge the gap between the two services.

\*This extension only works with chartink and supports only NSE stocks.
